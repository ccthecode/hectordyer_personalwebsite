2020 - ongoing

I am interested in medical history, how our bodies can become viewed or compared to machines and the consequences of this. Disassembling and reassembling the body, looking at different methods of healing are my main focuses at the moment.

I work with discarded pieces of second-hand cloth which I view as living beings. The process of making and reassembling these scraps is another form of healing and realignment.
I respond through my own experience as a disabled, non-binary person and the ongoing physical negotiations this provokes.
