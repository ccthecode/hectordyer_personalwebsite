2021 and 2022

A work in progress which addresses the intersection of the environment, democracy and big tech. 
This film collages together found footage and sound from social media, news channels, YouTube uploads and more, alongside personal footage and recordings. It brings the idea of collective and personal memory to explore how individual activism relates to wider political change.
Commissioned by Metal Liverpool, the full film is available here: http://www.metalculture.com/feet-on-cloud-by-hector-dyer/
