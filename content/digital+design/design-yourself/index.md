2019 - ongoing

What does it mean to be human when technology is changing everything? As a collective, we work across sound, movement, language and aesthetics to respond to this idea and the futures it suggests. Most of our early works were video and we are now expanding in all directions :)
We formed this collective after participating in a Barbican Creative Learning programme around AI technology, working with lead artist Antonio Roberts. Below are some stills from works we have previously made, with the full videos here, and our IG here.
